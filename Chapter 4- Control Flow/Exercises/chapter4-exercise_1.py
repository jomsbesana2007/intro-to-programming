## Exercise 1:  Alien Colors #1 :ballot_box_with_check:

# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

# •Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

# •Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)


# The program that passes the if-test

# the 'alien_color' variable is initialised with a value of 'green'
alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations, the color of the alien is green! You've just earned 5 points!")


# The program that fails the if-test and doesn't display anything
alien_color = 'red'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations, the color of the alien is green! You've just earned 5 points!")
