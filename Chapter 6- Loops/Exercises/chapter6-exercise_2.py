## Exercise 2: Movie Tickets

# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a person’s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if

# they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. 

# Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket


# The 'loop' variable is initialised with the value of True so that the loop goes on indefinitely
loop = True

# A while loop that asks the users their age and displays the prices corresponding to their age
while loop:

    age = int(input("\nEnter your age: "))

    if age < 3:
        print("\nYour ticket is free!")

    elif age <= 12:
        print("\nYour ticket is $10")

    elif age > 12:
        print("\nYour ticket is $15")
